 a quick view about their configuration/resources.

This script only shows basic information about your systems. It doesn't give any kind of recommendation or 
correction regarding configuration,security issues, etc... (for this other purpose you can use: https://github.com/nx0/SSC)

This script was tested in:
* Fedora 19
* RedHAT 6/4
* Ubuntu 10/11/14
* Suse 10/11
* Debian 7
